## Build Analysis

Production build size (after Week 3):
- React vendor: 163.67 kB → 53.53 kB gzipped
- TanStack libs: 39.50 kB → 11.98 kB gzipped (includes Router)
- **ECharts (lazy-loaded)**: 1,055.99 kB → 349.29 kB gzipped
- QuickAnalysis page: 16.39 kB → 4.65 kB gzipped
- Projects page: 5.59 kB → 1.95 kB gzipped
- ProjectDetail page: 4.54 kB → 1.72 kB gzipped
- FileUploader: 63.91 kB → 18.20 kB gzipped
- Types: 77.82 kB → 21.22 kB gzipped
- shadcn/ui components: 79.75 kB → 26.47 kB gzipped
- Main bundle: 99.65 kB → 35.06 kB gzipped
- **Total initial load**: ~171 kB gzipped ✅ (66% under 500kB target)
- **Charts loaded on demand**: +349 kB gzipped (only when viewing charts)

Performance targets met:
- ✅ Bundle size < 500kB
- ✅ Code splitting working
- ✅ Lazy loading routes

## API Integration

The frontend connects to the FastAPI backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Axios Configuration

- Base URL from environment variables
- JWT token automatically attached to requests
- 401 errors trigger automatic logout
- Error messages extracted from backend responses

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits login/register form
2. TanStack Query mutation calls backend API
3. JWT token stored in localStorage
4. Zustand store updated with user data
5. Axios interceptor attaches token to all requests
6. Protected routes check authentication status

## ✅ Quick Analysis MVP Complete!

All features for the Quick Analysis MVP have been implemented:
- File upload with drag-drop
- Data preview with schema visualization
- Automatic chart generation (4 types)
- AI-powered insights
- PDF export functionality
- Mobile responsive design
- Error handling and loading states

## ✅ Week 3 Multi-file Projects (Phase 1) Complete!

**Week 3 Completion Status**: 100% Complete

- [ ] Dashboard builder (pin charts, custom layouts)
- [ ] Share analysis via link
- [ ] Saved analysis history

## Development Notes

- All routes are lazy loaded for optimal bundle size
- Forms use React Hook Form + Zod for validation
- Auth state persists in localStorage via Zustand
- JWT expires after 7 days (backend configured)
- Dark mode support ready (toggle coming soon)

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use
```bash
# Kill process on port 5173
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
```

### TypeScript errors
```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm install
```

### Backend connection issues
Ensure backend is running at `http://localhost:8000` and CORS is configured.
