## Why These Were Archived

As part of documentation cleanup on November 15, 2025, we consolidated all active documentation into three core files:

1. **README.md** (root) - Comprehensive project overview, setup, features
2. **CLAUDE.md** (root) - Development guidelines for AI assistants
3. **PROGRESS.md** (root) - Current project status tracker

This archive preserves:
- Historical context (how features were built)
- Implementation details from each phase
- Original planning documents
- Phase-by-phase completion reports

---

## Using Archived Docs

**When to reference these files**:
- Understanding implementation history
- Learning how a specific feature was built
- Reviewing original requirements
- Researching design decisions

**Note**: Information in archived docs may be outdated. Always check the main documentation first:
- `/README.md` - For current features and setup
- `/CLAUDE.md` - For current architecture and development workflow
- `/PROGRESS.md` - For current project status
